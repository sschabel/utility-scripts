# Utility Scripts

## Rename and Move MP4 Files
This script is used to just rename MP4 files to the datetime specified in the ``Media created`` property and then move any files in child directories to the root directory.

Here is an example of how run it:
```PowerShell
.\rename-and-move-mp4-files.ps1 "C:\Users\your-username\Desktop\MP4-root-folder\"
```
